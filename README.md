**ML Project Repository**
Welcome to my Machine Learning Project repository! This repository contains three exciting projects showcasing different machine learning models and concepts, along with beautiful data visualizations and descriptions.

**1. 🏡 House Price Prediction**
Description
In this project, I have developed a House Price Prediction model using Linear Regression. I applied the concepts of gradient descent, data scaling, and data visualization to create an accurate and efficient model. My model can predict house prices with remarkable accuracy, helping you make informed real estate decisions.

**2. 💰 Loan Status Prediction**
Description
This project focuses on Loan Status Prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM). I've built a robust model to determine whether an individual is eligible for a loan based on various factors. It's a valuable tool for financial institutions to assess loan applicants' creditworthiness, reducing risk and streamlining the lending process.

**3. 🌙 MakeMoon Dataset with Decision Trees**
Description
Explore the enchanting world of the MakeMoon dataset with my Decision Tree model. I've implemented a powerful decision tree algorithm to classify data points within this unique dataset. This project showcases the versatility of decision trees and their ability to handle complex data.

Feel free to dive into each project's respective folder for in-depth documentation and code. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me. I hope you find these projects insightful and inspiring for your own machine learning endeavors.

**Happy coding! **🚀🤖📊
